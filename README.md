In my resume, I previously included a link to this repository, mentioning plans to develop a 2D video game. However, I decided to pivot from that project and focus on building other, more impactful projects that better align with my learning goals and career aspirations. Below are the links to the projects I worked on instead:

Estimating-Pi-with-Monte-Carlo - https://github.com/franchelo2311/Estimating-Pi-with-Monte-Carlo

Neural-Network-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition - https://github.com/franchelo2311/Neural-Network-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
